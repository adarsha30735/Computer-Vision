The generalized Hough transform is a method to find an object in an image that looks like a
given model. It works by identifying a set of parameters that connect the model to the image.
Once we know these parameters, we can determine the position of the model in the image.
The generalized Hough transform is a modified version of the Hough transform, which was
originally used to detect simple shapes like lines, circles, and ellipses. However, with the
generalized Hough transform, we can detect more complex and arbitrary objects. In this
work, we will go through the implementation of genialized Hough transform using Python to
detect faces of human. Section 2 of the report will discuss various methods involved in the
detecting the object like faces. Section 3 will talk about experimental details set for detecting
the face of a human in the given image. Section 4 will show the results obtained from the
implementation of Generalized Hough transform in Python. Finally, section 5 will conclude
the report. In addition, appendix is provided at the end of this report which show the Python
implementation using Jupyter Notebook
