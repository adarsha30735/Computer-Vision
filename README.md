# Image Restoration using Gradient Descent and Mean Field Annealing

This repository contains Python implementations of image restoration techniques using gradient descent and mean field annealing (MFA). The methods aim to restore images degraded by noise, focusing on optimizing the image quality using Gaussian and Laplacian priors.
